# Data Science for Social Good - Housing
## Description

## Dependencies
The script was written and tested with Scrapy 1.5.0 and Python 3.6+ on both Windows 10 
and Mac. 

Tip: For Windows 10, `pip install scrapy` does not always work. Install scrapy through 
another package manager; Anaconda worked best in our experience.  

Splash is required for running VSpider (tested with version 3.2).
