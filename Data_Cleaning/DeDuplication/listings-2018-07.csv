Hello,,
,
I am looking for someone to begin renting out a bedroom at the beginning of September 2018. The room is a fair size and there is a bathroom right across the hall that will mainly be yours to use. The bathroom has a stand-up shower in it. The cost for rent each month is $800.00. Rent is due the 1st of every month. ,
,
The apartment is pretty spacious, it is 1100 square feet. It includes a washer and dryer in the unit, full kitchen, dining room, living room and balcony that will be shared with me. There tends to be parking in the parking lot of the building and if it is full, parking on the street isn't too hard to find. We are on the 3rd/top floor of the building. The majority of the apartment was renovated in August 2017 except for the kitchen. ,
,
The following costs are to be split between us. These are due on the 18th of every month. ,
,
- Hydro (every other month) can be $20-$60 dollars each depending on our use for those months.,
- Internet is $44.80 per month each,
- Renter's Insurance is approximately $16.00 each,
,
I am looking for someone who is fairly quiet and very clean/minimalistic in the shared spaces. The buildings quiet times are between 10pm and 7am. ,
,
As this will also be your space, you are more than welcome to have people over. Please just give me a heads up in advance about it. ,
,
Parties are okay on occasion as long as a heads up is given and you are respecting the building rules and me. ,
,
No smoking, no pets. ,
,
If you're interested in looking at the space, please send me an email.,
,

Looking for an awesome roomie to share with two others in a large house. You'll have more room to yourself than with most single rentals! This is better suited to someone with their own furnishings anyway. ,
,
You'll have two bedrooms on the top floor (other roomie is in the master suite, I'm in the basement). Use one room as a bedroom, and the other as your own separate living room / office / yoga room / craft room / whatever. Both rooms are unfurnished, and large enough for a full bedroom set of furniture. Full bathroom is not ensuite, but is all yours. ,
,
Main floor is shared space. Large kitchen with gas range and walk-in pantry, as well as a laundry room. You will need to have your own kitchen stuff as that is not provided. Combined, the top and main floor are about 2300 square feet. ,
,
Good sized backyard with water feature, large deck, and view of Langley City. Central location with easy access to KPU, TWU, or to the highway for an easy commute into Vancouver. ,
,
About us: We're two women (mid-30's) and seeking someone who we'll get along with. Females strongly preferred, but options are open for the right person (ideally a single professional in the same age group). Single adult occupant only. Must be ok with cats. Expected to do their share of house and yard work. Quiet household, but the occasional dinner party / board game night will definitely occur. ,
,
Rent is $850 plus a 25% share of utilities (hydro and gas, currently under $100 a month).    ",49.126494, (Langley),-122.671108,$850,,,Craigslist,2300ft,Seeking roommate for large house - great location,https://vancouver.craigslist.ca/rds/roo/d/seeking-roommate-for-large/6631057411.html

NO PETS PLEASE,

I'm building a new house in Brookswood and it will have a legal, two bedroom suite on the top floor.  It is 810 square feet, with a private entrance, your own parking spot, and all the latest creature comforts one would expect from a new, high end home.,
,
Fully soundproofed from main house!,
,
Amenities include:,
,
Two bedrooms,
One full bath with tub,
Quartz counters,
Maple cabinetry,
Laminate flooring,
Stainless steel appliances,
Low E, double glazed windows,
Very close to transit, shopping, schools and parks,
In suite laundry,
Radiant in floor heating,
Seperate security system for suite,
,
The suite is built above my attached garage, and only shares the following common walls (all of which have been soundproofed) with the main house.,
,
1. The suite bathroom is adjacent to the bedroom of my 5yr old son and his bathroom,
2. The suite bedroom wall is adjacent to my laundry room,
,
What this means, is you'll likely never hear us and vice versa.  We are a pretty quiet family of four.  We don't party and don't often entertain at our home.  This is ideal for two roommates or a single parent or couple with a young child.  Both the bedrooms are spacious with a closet in each.  Your entrance is on the opposite side of the house from ours and you don't have to enter our backyard to get in so it is a very private suite.

Pretty much your own place!! Fully furnished except your bedroom. Can get a bed and dressor for you if needed. Healthy, clean, quiet roommate wanted. I'll only be at the place maybe once a week as I'm also living in Vancouver. This is a month to month rental.  I'm an actor, stuntman and fitness fanatic so I'll be living downtown and there part time. There are nice tenants living downstairs so someone quiet is important. Obviously weekends you can be a little louder. It's a big house on a big lot in a great neighbourhood. Parking on street. You get your own half bathroom located in the hallway. Hydro, gas, cable, internet, laundry included. Cable in room. Walking distance to shops, parks, hospital and beach. I'm 40 but have a happy, younger personality and I'm just seeing what's out there. Not desperate to find anyone at all. If you're cool, happy and healthy then msg me.

Hi Everyone, ,
,
My suite is located in a relatively brand new high rise condo in the Two Park Place building adjacent to King George Skytrain, Holland Park, Central City Shopping Mall, and SFU Surrey.

,
You will sleep in the living room.  A single mattress will be provided. You will also have a dresser drawer to put your clothes.  ,
,
You will be sharing the rest of the suite with two gay men who both will have their own rooms.,
,
Your bathroom is shared and is also a guest bathroom.,
,
The rent is $675.00 per month. This includes ,
,

The kitchen has a brand new microwave oven and dishwasher and new appliances.,

,
The suite is located on the sixth floor with great floor to ceiling views in the living room.,
,
The living room is a shared space for all members of the household except at-night when your sleeping. ,
,
Having a suite on the sixth floor is very handy in case you need to use the stairs to evacuate quickly in case of a fire, and you usually get off the elevator first as well. ,

,North Vancouver,CA,,"  This fabulous waterfront apartment on Indian Arm in North Vancouver is just 30 minutes from beautiful downtown Vancouver, the cleanest most beautiful city in the world!
Located on Indian Arm, a 10,000 year old fiord in a West Coast rain forest, the community of Woodlands is one of Vancouver's best kept secrets, not many people know we are here and we like it that way! Woodlands is one of Vancouver's oldest summer communities which consists of waterfront homes accessed by a 5 km country road which winds its way through the forests of Mt. Seymour, a provincial park, well known for its snowshoeing, skiing, golfing, hiking, and mountain biking, so don't forget your bike! Woodlands is much less crowded than Deep Cove and gives you that remote feeling without being remote.
   There is  an 80 foot cement deck with gazebo and bar-b-q which for your own use. There is a 50 foot dock which holds the kayaks and rowboat as well as 2 gravity chairs, perfect for sunbathing. The dock is shared with the owners to access their boat. Watch seals, seabirds, yachts, and fish boats make their way up Indian Arm to the beautiful Wigwam Inn, a private yacht club with a scandalous past! Across from the Wigwam is the majestic Granite Falls Marine Park.
  Bring your scuba gear as there is excellent diving right out the front door! 2 kayaks and a Walker Bay rowboat are available free of charge. Spend an afternoon exploring the many marine parks home to black bears, bald eagles, and two salmon runs a year. Power boat rentals are available at Seycove Marina in Deep Cove.
    The picturesque village of Deep Cove is just around the corner. It is home to beautiful gift shops, including Ahoy which is Herschel Backpacks flagship store, the designer lives nearby, many restaurants, as well as the forest hike to Quarry Rock Lookout and  Baden Powell Trail which stretches for 50 km, all the way to Horseshoe Bay. The Seymour Art Gallery, Shaw Theatre, Northlands Golf Course, Seycove Marina Boat Rentals, Arm Reach Bistro, Parkgate Community Centre and Library are all close by. Come and experience waterfront living at its finest without breaking the bank, only a 50.00 cleaning fee and 100.00 refundable damage deposit, one of the least expensive on any vacation rental website. 4 day minimum in July and August. Most suitable for 2 to 3 adults or 2 adults and 3 children. One queen bed and 2 double. 4 night minimum over Christmas Holidays and March break. Check in is 3pm and check out is 10 AM. Rates in Canadian dollars are 200 in low season 3 night minimum 240 May and June 3 night minimum and 240 in high season, July and August 5 night minimum.

,Richmond,CA,,"Located on the Vancouver Airport hotel strip (Bridgeport Road), this private, ground-floor apartment in a family home is ideal for layovers as well as longer term stays.  You'll love the apartment because of all the natural light, the privacy and its location. Walk to the skytrain to access downtown Vancouver or enjoy a meal at several restaurants in the neighborhood.  The River Rock Casino, the Richmond Night Market and the Fraser River dyke are just steps from our door.  We welcome you to your new (temporary) home with a jar of honey from our own beehives!

AIRPORT INFO: Travelers looking to stay close to the airport will enjoy the convenience of the location.  However, our proximity to the airport also means a bit of noise!  :)

THE NEIGHBORHOOD:  This apartment is located on Bridgeport Road, on the same stretch of road where many other airport hotels are located. Some of the restaurants within walking distance include: Moxie's, Ginger Indian, Tim Hortons, Korean BBQ, Denny's and Starbucks. Great shows, dining and entertainment are just around the corner at the River Rock Casino & Resort. If you want to get out into nature, we suggest taking a walk towards the dyke along the Fraser River. If you have a car, you may want to explore the shoreline at Iona Beach (10 km away).

GETTING AROUND: The Canada Line skytrain is a 15 minute walk or two minute bus ride. A bus stop is located at the front of the house. The 430 or 407 bus will take you to the Bridgeport Skytrain Station. From the Bridgeport Station, downtown Vancouver, downtown Richmond and the Airport are easily accessable. Parking is available in the driveway at the front of the property if you arrive by car. Groceries can be purchased at the small convenience store across the street or at Costco (.5 km away).

PARKING & ACCESS:  Parking is availble on the property, at the front. Head down the driveway to the back of the house and look for the door with the word ""bonjour"" on it. Use the key-code (we will provide) to let yourself in. This is a private entrance.

OTHER THINGS TO NOTE:  We do offer laundry facilities on the premises, but the washer and dryer are shared with us. Let us know if/when you would like to use them and we will make the laundry room accessable to you.

Because we do not charge a cleaning fee, we do ask our guests wash and put away their dishes before check out. Thank you.

You will need an Apple ID to use the television in the room.

MONTHLY PRICING AVAILABLE: October through March.
Book early for best availability.

Guest Access:

Come and go as you please, as this cottage is separate from our main residence. Keyless entry makes after hours check-in/out a breeze and the best part is no extra fees! Park easily on the street, or in the lane in front of the cottage, also free!

PLEASE NOTE:
You will be provided your own personal entry code before check-in.
For entry: Enter code (see green light), pull door toward you, turn knob to the left.
For exit: Press 'EMTEK', pull door toward you, turn knob to the right.

Interaction with Guests:

We respect that each guest is unique and has different needs. We will make every effort to welcome you when possible, and make local recommendations. The beauty of Rose Cottage is that it is a separate dwelling with digital key pad, allowing for a maximum of privacy.

The Neighbourhood:

Step out your front door, cross the lane and enjoy everything John Hendry park has to offer. This includes a large lake with beautiful walking/cycling trails, sandy beach with gorgeous mountain views, rec center, two kids playgrounds, market and concession in summer, and plenty more to discover.

A short walk in the park takes you to the brand new, state-of-the-art Trout Lake Recreation Center, featuring Olympic skating rink, fitness center, tennis and basketball courts, outstanding children's playground, a cafe, and more! Detailed information is available by using your favorite search engine: type 'city of vancouver trout lake'

The Vancouver Farmers Market operates Saturdays from 9am-2pm literally steps from your door, May through October. Exact dates and vendor information is available by using your favorite search engine: type 'eatlocal'

PLEASE NOTE:
A parking pass is required to park in the neighbourhood during market hours.

Getting around:

Take a pleasant stroll to vibrant Commercial Drive, once known as 'Little Italy'. Voted one of the top 10 hippest hoods in North America, it is one of the most culturally diverse and eclectic spots to visit in Vancouver. Find a plethora of authentic Italian coffee bars, fine dining restaurants, European delis, unique boutiques, and organic food stores. This is a hub for Vancouver's live music and theater scenes, art exhibitions, poetry readings, cafe culture, environmental activism, and alternative lifestyle. Find more info by using your favorite search engine: type 'commercial drive business society'

A short walk takes you to the intersection of Commercial Drive & East Broadway offering two Sky Train stations and many major bus routes. This is very fortunate, as the Sky Train provides fast and inexpensive transport to and from downtown, the airport, North Vancouver and much more. The #99 B-Line bus also stops here and is a quick and direct line to UBC.

A handy route planner can be found at the translink website.

Other Things to Note:

For the FASTEST and most serene walking/cycling ROUTE TO COMMERCIAL DRIVE: May we suggest that you travel North on Lakewood Drive. You will cross a small bridge, turn left at the end of it onto the Central Valley Greenway/BC Parkway/North Grandview Hwy. This will take you to the corner of E. Broadway & Victoria Drive, from here you will be able to see the Sky Train stations. Cross the street in both directions (both North and West) and continue on the BC Parkway/North Grandview Hwy in the direction of Northwest. This is a lovely shortcut, it will take you directly to Commercial Drive through a pretty and quiet residential setting. See a map of this route in the photos.

Please note there are a number of local laundromats (many offer pick up/drop-off service). There is no washer/dryer on site.

If you have a smart phone or laptop we would highly recommend two apps to help you find your way around town. One is called 'Around Me', which will show nearby businesses and includes maps and routes to any location or place you type in.
The other is called 'Yelp' which has reviews of nearby businesses as well as directions. For fun things to see and do go to the 'tourismvancouver' website.

Looking to rent out one or two rooms in a very nice, newer Clayton Heights Townhouse (right near Fraser Hwy and 64 Ave). ,
There is two rooms on the top floor with 1 bathroom, a kitchen and living space on middle floor, and a garage, 1 den, and a bathroom on the bottom floor. There is a a driveway that will fit a car, SUV, or smaller truck. I park on the street as my truck is too large for this space, so it could be yours.,
,
Will rent 1 room out upstairs for $900 (plus 1/2 utilities and wifi/cable) - or will rent the upstairs (2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom) out for $1600 (plus 1/2 or 2/3 utilities and wifi/cable-depending on # of renters). If the top floor is rented out entirely I will live on the bottom floor.,
,
I am a female in my mid 20's. I work a lot and often go away on weekends so I am not home a great deal. When I am home it is just to cook, sleep, and lay low in my room. There is a TV with cable/netflix on the main floor which I never watch so it would be available to you. Looking for someone, or two people who are trustworthy and will pay rent on time and respect the townhouse.,

,North Vancouver,CA,,"A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN A UNIQUELY BEAUTIFUL LOCATION YET CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER...

At our beautiful location, you are immersed in the incredible wild nature of B.C., and still only 20 minutes from Downtown Vancouver! We are at the foot of Mount Seymour, a great ski hill just a 15 minute drive up the road. You can access incredible hikes from your doorstep through forest, kayaking and boating up Indian Arm, and many more great outdoors adventures while having easy access to the city.  (For more information click on our website link below further down this page, by scrolling down you will find it right after the Owner Info and Contact Us sections.)  

You have a beautiful, quiet, bright, spacious home, on a huge property with a large landscaped garden with a stream running through it. We just extended the roof above the deck so that it's completely covered.  It means you can be out on the deck at all times of the year.  The garden now has multi level bench seating surrounding a fire pit including it's own trails throughout. Deanna Kasta, the architect owner has lovingly remodeled her prize home, preserving the rich warmth of the Cedar walls and exposed beams, and taking advantage of the amazing views over Deep Cove which you can see from the panoramic windows, the big, wide deck, and the outdoor hot-tub. It is such a delight to soak in the hot-tub beneath the stars, away from city lights, and return to a wood fire in the comfort of your Deep Cove home.  The house is on a large (200 x 50 ft) property with a mountain stream and there is a managers' apartment on site for convenient help at any time.

The views here are enthusiastically declared, by all who visit, to be of the best in Vancouver; the tall, ancient forests, pristine mountains and islands, and the calm sparkling ocean. You can watch bald eagles, hawks and humming birds, and you might even be lucky enough to see a bear or a deer!

We provide all the amenities you need to call home, so that you can be self- sufficient and economical, all with a hot tub below with it's own view and the stream running through the entire property. We include great furnishings, a fully equipped kitchen and laundry room, fresh linens and towels, and a package with maps, information, and tips to help you acclimatize. All utilities and services are all free and unlimited, including; a new Movie quality 60"" Flat Screen TV with cable and Netflix, and high-speed wireless internet for all your devices!!!  We even have a Ping Pong table in our enclosed carport that you can use.

You will love being in the quiet yet friendly Deep Cove Community with it's local theatrical plays and quaint downtown.  It couldn't be more lovely.   But please don't take our word for it...  look at our many 5/5 star reviews included on this site or look at our own website.  Our many guests over the last eight plus years express the unique experience of an Eagles Nest stay best.  

Noise Restrictions:  Our Deep Cove neighborhood is very quiet with four foot setbacks between houses, which is normal for our residential area.  The neighborhood is very pristine and quiet and noise can travel quite far here.  It is almost completely residential, so noise after 10:00 pm and before 9 am cannot be tolerated.  This is especially true out on our deck and in the Garden and outdoor Hot Tub.  Please be careful about this because we would not be able to have you as guests in Deep Cove without it.  If you do make excessive noise after 10:00 pm or before 9 am or excessive noise in the house that bother our neighbors, we reserve the right to ask you to leave without a refund.  Please understand Eagles Nest is not and cannot be a Party House.  If this is your intention for your trip, we respectfully ask you please find a more appropriate venue.  

Parking Restrictions: Usually we have ample parking for families or friends staying at Eagle's Nest. We have room for 3 cars parked close together in front of our carport here at 2490 Caledonia Ave. (The reason for this is our neighbors have one parking space to the left of our garage (as you face the garage) near their steep driveway.))  The very small amount of street parking on this narrow street is highly valued by residents who have steep driveways, so when there are unfamiliar cars on the street, the neighbours can get upset. So for more than three cars, please use the free car park on Panorama Drive (the parallel road below) and shuttle each other up. The distance (2 ½ blocks) can also be walked easily.  Also please be careful not to block our neighbour's driveway and remember it is a quiet family neighbourhood.

Renting out my main bedroom in my 1 bedroom apartment. I do have 3 pets so you must be okay with 2 cats and a small dog. This is the typical toomage situation where we share the bathroom, kitchen and dining room. I have the living room sectioned off as my bedroom. I just ask that you respect my privacy and I'll respect yours. Also cleaning up after yourself is a must. I know it shouldn't have to be said but I've found from the past it does. Kitchen comes with a dishwasher to wish I supply the soap so you don't even have to do your dishes lol. Just throw me them in and let th dishwasher take care of the rest. Please if you drink excessively, do drugs or smoke this isn't the place for you. The building management is new and has a zero tolerance for marijuana use and smoking. I also work 70 hours a week between 2 jobs so I tend to use any downtime I have to be with my pets or at the gym. ,

Looking for a quiet, responsible person to rent one furnished (or can be non-furnished, though this does not change the price of the rental) bedroom in a two bedroom apartment in the Guildford neighbourhood of North Surrey. The bedroom is private, but the renter will be sharing the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. The apartment is on the first floor, has a large balcony, and large windows; the total size is approximately 900 square feet. Laundry facilities are located just down the hall from the apartment. Two short-haired, spayed/neutered cats do live in the apartment, too, so it's probably not ideal for a person with allergies. No additional pets allowed. Apartment is in an older building, so no amenities such as a dishwasher. Appliances are apartment-sized (small). There is a portable air conditioner for hotter weather.,
,
The location is a five minute walk from the Guildford Exchange bus loop, Guildford Town Centre, the library and rec centre, grocery stores, and plenty of shops and restaurants. It is a five minute drive to/from Highway 1. It is ideal for students. The 335 bus stops are just steps away and it goes directly to Gateway Skytrain station (it takes about 15 minutes to get from the bus stop to the Skytrain). Easy and quick access to New Westminster, Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, and Maple Ridge.,
,
Utilities are included with the rent and must be paid by the 1st of the month. Parking is an additional $10 per month and you will receive an assigned space. ,
,
IMPORTANT NOTE: You must love cats. My cats are very friendly and love to play. If you don't love cats, then this isn't the apartment for you.,
,
About me: I'm a mid-30-something female cisgender Queer children's librarian who loves sci fi, fantasy, and all things nerdy. I'm a Wiccan and love board games, RPG, and am radically liberal on political and social issues. I do love Halloween and Christmas, so from October to January 1, the apartment will be decorated like a theme park.,
,
Please email for an application or if you have any questions. Apartment will not be vacant until August 15; no viewings/interviews will be scheduled until then.

Looking to fill a room in a basement suite I'm currently renting and living in.  This is a great place with fantastic landlords who live above us, in a really quiet neighbourhood of Surrey.  There is a washer/dryer and dishwasher.  All utilities are included (plus internet, but I have my own that is working better at the moment - split between us it'll be $25 a month).  The place also has a security system, though I never use it (again, it's a very quiet and peaceful part of Surrey).  Most of the place is already furnished, though will be in need of a TV and dining table as those are my roommates.  Everything else is mine.  Your room isn't furnished though.  There is a bus route to Guildford and Central Surrey 10 min walk up the street.,
,
I'm looking for a quiet and chill person who doesn't smoke or do drugs, and is clean and responsible.  No parties.  A young professional is preferred but students are welcome too.  Hoping to find someone that will feel more like a friend then a roommate, as it's nice to come home and chat with someone from time to time.,
,
I'm a 27 year old wm, currently working in an animation studio downtown Vancouver.  For that reason, I'm typically only around in the evenings on the weekdays.  I'm quiet and clean, introverted, and like to spend my spare time playing video games or watching movies.  I have a few board games, so if you're into board games, big plus there.  ,
,
I have a young cat named Aloy.  Unfortunately she doesn't get along with other cats or dogs though so I won't be able to accept any ( as much as I would love to ).  Other caged animals may be alright though, would have to discuss that with my landlord.,
,
IF INTERESTED, please message by text or email, and tell me a bit about yourself.,
,
Edit: Please no couples or sharing of the room.  Landlord wants only 2 occupants in place.

Why rent a small basement or coach house when you can share a much larger, brighter space with a large yard? House is big enough that no one should be stepping on anyone else's toes. ,
,
About the house:,
- you'll be sharing about 2300 square feet, mostly with just one other person,
- you'll have two rooms to yourself, plus a private bathroom (not furnished, and you can paint if you wish),
- large kitchen with walk in pantry and gas range,
- laundry room on main,
- large deck and garden,
- double garage for additional storage or workspace,
,
Who you are:,
- looking for longer term, at least a year,
- ok with cats,
- single professional, preferably female (we're both females in our 30's),
- looking for a little more room to entertain / cook / hang out / whatever,
- willing to help out with your share of chores around the house, including basic yard maintenance,
- have your own furniture (best suited for someone living in a suite who just wants some more space - only the living room is furnished now),
,
The details:,
- $850 a month plus 25% of gas and hydro and a $40 contribution towards cable / internet (works out to under $1000 all in),
- security deposit required, plus will be asked to sign a roommate agreement,
- available for August or a little earlier (house is currently being painted so will be all bright and shiny),
- single occupancy only, please don't ask if you're a couple / family etc. ,
- if this ad is still posted, it is still available,
,
Please email with a little bit of information about why you'd be an awesome roommate. I won't answer people who simply ask ""can I come see the place"". This is for a roommate situation, not a rental, so we need to make sure we're compatible before anything else. Coffee first, then the house tour!

Say Good bye to having a friend over.,
The place is rat infested. If you tell the landlord about the infestation, she will blame it on you for having food in the house. ,
Drug abuse is a normal thing by the other tenant in the house...As long as the landlords get the rent, they don't care....,
She comes into your place when you are not around. ,
Don't flush your toilet if you want to be a long-term tenant and have peace. The landlord believes that flushing makes the water bill go higher. So, the wife will make your life a living hell that you will run leaving your shoes behind like I did. ,
They play games to sucker you in: they offer rent with all utilities included, but she will ask for more money, making excuses that the city has raised the fee you must pay....,
If you are given internet and cable, the deal won't last.  1st they cut off the internet and ask for more money. If you don't' pay, they make excuses about the router not working and waiting for the service provider to come....,

Hi, I am a 25 year old guy looking for a roommate. I work for a security company, and have been for over 2 years now. I am quiet and clean and have a shy but friendly dog who spends most of his time hiding in my room.,
,
The house is fairly new, has marble countertops and heated floors for the winter. Small but easy to clean. 1 bathroom with a bath/shower. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Gateway Skytrain. There is no laundry on site but there are a couple laundromats nearby and you may be able to work out a deal with the neighbors to do your laundry as I have. The house is partially furnished but there is room for a bit more.,
,
Rent is 750, with all utilities and internet included. Email if interested and tell me why you would make a good roommate.

Hi there! We are two professional, quiet, non partying women in our 20's who are looking for a third similar like-minded roommate in our home. Our beautiful townhouse is only ten years old, has a bus stop right outside the gate, and is only a 10 minute walk from Surrey Central Station. It is a two floor home that includes a balcony, dishwasher, and a washer/dryer. The common areas (living room, kitchen, etc) are already furnished. ,
,
On top of the rent we also have hydro and internet which we would split 3 ways (currently we do not have cable) There is no parking spot or storage locker available, however there is plenty of street parking nearby or around the corner. The bathroom upstairs pictured above would be shared with one other roommate.,
,
This unit would be a one year lease, and the rent is 615 per month. If your application is accepted we would require a deposit of half your rent ($300) ASAP to secure your spot. The keys and fob for the unit has a refundable deposit of $100 asked for by the Landlord. There is also a move in/out fee that is non refundable of $100 that is asked for by strata. (If planned with the roommate leaving fee could be split in half),
,
We are both no drama, easy going people who live busy lives. For us communication, and respect of both the place and eachother are very important, and we hope to find someone that will fit in here well. If interested shoot me a email for a quick response, and please include your name, a little bit about yourself, and a number we could reach you at. Cheers!,

Hello my husband and I are a young couple In our early 20s looking for roommates! We live in a 4 bedroom house with 3 bathrooms and a beautiful backyard with a gazebo in the Fraser heights area. You would have a choice between three rooms and you would have your own bathroom. Each room has natural lighting and its own closet. This house is very spacious and would fit everyone comfortably. We have two dogs that are super friendly. We don't have parties but occasionally like to have people over for a bbq. We are looking for respectful, clean, and responsible roommates. This would be great for a student or someone who works full time. First come first serve on the rooms so if this sounds like an awesome place then please contact me via email or by phone to set up a viewing. ,

The home features great overhanging eaves, easy transitions from indoor to outdoor spaces, massive timber beams and handicraft details.

Indoor and outdoor spaces flow seamlessly, as every home at Tsawwassen Springs features a Great Room with ample openings to the adjacent outdoor spaces. Here, you live both inside and outside, maximizing the enjoyment of the better weather, spectacular views and resort setting. Every home at Tsawwassen Springs, regardless of size, features single‐level living with a spacious master bedroom and ensuite and feature ceiling heights of impressive 10 feet. With oversized windows throughout, all homes at Tsawwassen Springs enjoy an abundance of natural light.,

,North Vancouver,CA,,"This seaside cottage is the guest house on our property in the Woodlands area of North Vancouver.  Indian Arm is the southernmost glacial fjord on the west coast of North America, extending 10 miles northeast inland from Burrard Inlet and Vancouver harbour.   Located on the eastern slope of Mount Seymour, the Woodlands area is a paradise for hiking, kayaking and mountain biking, where you are minutes away from the North Shore's Baden Powell Trail, Quarry Rock and legendary mountain biking terrain.  

The Cottage itself is a 2 story, 650 square foot building.  It is newly renovated with stainless steel appliances, quartz counter-tops, wood stove, a private deck, garden and patio with a propane barbecue. Upstairs there is a queen bed, sofa, and TV with surround sound.
The Woodlands area is a secluded group of waterfront properties on the shore of Indian Arm, just north of Deep Cove.  Part of the Woodlands adventure is the road.  Indian River Drive was built in 1909 to connect Woodlands to the rest of North Vancouver.  It was not paved until the 1990s, and today is a beautiful 5KM winding trip through mature second growth rain forest.    
Summertime at Woodlands is glorious and beautiful.  The property faces east, so you will enjoy the sunrise.  Then there's winter.  It rains here in the winter.  A lot.  Nearby Deep Cove is sometimes called 'Deepest Darkest Cove' during the November - March months.  It doesn't snow here often, but when it does we have to park at the top of the Fire Lane and hike to and from the house.  Keeps us fit, though.  We have a propane  supply, a firewood supply and a backup generator.  We are ready for the zombie apocalypse.  Or winter at Woodlands.  Whichever comes first.  You can stay here in the winter, but don't say we didn't warn you!

Hi there! We are two professional, quiet, non partying women in our 20's who are looking for a third similar like-minded roommate in our home. Our beautiful townhouse is only ten years old, has a bus stop right outside the gate, and is only a 10 minute walk from Surrey Central Station. It is a two floor home that includes a balcony, dishwasher, and a washer/dryer. The common areas (living room, kitchen, etc) are already furnished. ,
,
On top of the rent we also have hydro and internet which we would split 3 ways (currently we do not have cable) There is no parking spot or storage locker available, however there is plenty of street parking nearby or around the corner. The bathroom upstairs pictured above would be shared with one other roommate.,
,
This unit would be a one year lease, and the rent is 615 per month. If your application is accepted we would require a deposit of half your rent ($300) ASAP to secure your spot. The keys and fob for the unit has a refundable deposit of $100 asked for by the Landlord. There is also a move in/out fee that is non refundable of $100 that is asked for by strata. (If planned with the roommate leaving fee could be split in half),
,
We are both no drama, easy going people who live busy lives. For us communication, and respect of both the place and eachother are very important, and we hope to find someone that will fit in here well. If interested shoot me a email for a quick response, and please include your name, a little bit about yourself, and a number we could reach you at. Cheers!,

Unit area: 900 sq ft.  Note - pictures are from 5 years ago when my husband and I lived there.  The living area and kitchen floors have been replaced with a light vinyl plank in Feb 2017 which make the space much lighter.  ,
,
Location: Clayton Heights - one of Surrey's most desirable areas. Close to multiple supermarkets, gyms, and Willowbrook Mall. The suite has 2 large outdoor patio areas. Unit is close to stairs and elevator. Unit is a corner unit and let's in lots of light. One of the best units in the complex.,
,
Complex:  Sunset Grove - this is a carriage home which can be best described as a cross between a townhouse and a condo.  There are less shared walls and neighbours than a condo and no hassle with an elevator.  Parking is underground, and out front on the street (we have found this works better than having a smaller garage in a townhome as we don't have to worry about parking one vehicle in front of the other and coordinating schedules).,
,
Features: In-suite laundry, fridge/stove/dishwasher/microwave in kitchen.  Updated flooring in kitchen & living area. Outside of the complex and interior were painted last year (interior is now a light grey).,
